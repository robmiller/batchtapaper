# batchtapaper

Got a long list of URLs that you need to get into your
[Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/) account? Batchtapaper is
probably what you're looking for.

You'll often encounter things like Byliner's wonderful [curated
end-of-year lists of
articles](http://byliner.com/spotlights/102-spectacular-nonfiction-articles-2012).
I want to read all of them, but I don't want to have to add each one of
them to my Instapaper account manually; so, I use Batchtapaper.
